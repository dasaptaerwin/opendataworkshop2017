## Research data management plans

What we have learned so far:  

* Increasing data and methods publishing can really move science forward
     + It will help you as a researcher (you can find data and use methods easier)    
     + It will help the whole science community    
     + It might resolve some of the issues around peer review and costs of  publishing    
   
* Good meta data are the key for data re-use and discovery  
* Writing meta data is quite a job, especially after the fact  
* We need to develop strategies and methods to tackle this when we start!  

*  **Research data management plans**


## What are the main components of a research data management plan?

Unsurprisingly: **Metadata**  

- Who are involved (who owns the data): Administration and data ownership  
- How you collect the data: Data collection  
- How you consistently describe the data content: Data documentation
- Where you store the data and how you store the data (format and file structure): Data storage and data documentation
- How you plan to curate the data (where is the long-term home of the data): Data storage

* The RDMP at USYD is currently being revised to be more focussed on the actual research data management
* A living document, a "readme.txt" for the project.

* Choosing the right keywords for your project and data is crucial

    + feeds into all the further "downstream" metadata
